    <h1><a href="https://www.virgin.com/">Virgin America</a></h1>
    <p>     This website is one of my favorites because the website has just the right amount of information per page to be efficient and informative. The data is structured into an easily readable grid format with a good mix between media and text. It also has a red bold ribbon under every grid item to indicate what its genre is, like News, Richard, Unite…etc. I like the boldness of their pattern background and it has the added benefit of blending nicely with all the items of the page. The color pattern of the page reflects all the values of Virgin America which are boldness, activity, and discovery. The fonts go well with each other and overall eye-pleasing.</p>
    <h1><a href="http://www.adayinbigdata.com/">A Day In Big Data</a></h1>
    <p>     A day in Big Data is a stunning one-page website to spread awareness on big data and I think they did that with flying colors. The website is overly simple with 4 steps you scroll through with a Call on Action button on the landing screen of the page. The site has just the right amount of animations and media to keep the viewer interested throughout the viewing of the page. It has an animated line that follows your scrolling. The color pattern is sweet and simple composed of white and orange and only those colors to not overwhelm the viewer. The page uses only one font that goes well with a plain white background.</p>
    <h1><a href="https://www.theworldsworstwebsiteever.com/">The World's Worst Website Ever</a></h1>
    <p>     I believe this website is setting the record for what the worst website would be and an example of things to never do on a website. At a first glance the website looks ugly but the more you look at it, the more nauseous you get and the more the burning feeling in your eyes intensifies. The website looks right out of the 1990s and even to those standards, it would be considered ugly and an eyesore. Firstly, everything is off-center and none of the items follow any pattern, the background is a low-resolution picture in mosaic with a bevel around it. Secondly, paragraphs don’t follow the same size, every text paragraph has a different font and size and color, and to add salt to injury, some of the text is animated to move which makes it extremely difficult to read. There isn’t a color palette nor a uniform font. Finally, Word Art is just an eyesore and should be avoided at all costs.</p>

        Just over the horizon a great machine of death is roaring and rearing. <br>
        We can hear it always. Earthquake, starvation, the ever-renewing sump of corpse-flesh. <br>
        But in this valley the snow falls silently all day, and out our window <br>
        We see the curtain of it shifting and folding, hiding us away in our little house, <br>
        We see earth smoothened and beautified, made like a fantasy, the snow-clad trees <br>
        So graceful. In our new bed, which is big enough to seem like the north pasture almost <br>
        With our two cats, Cooker and Smudgins, lying undisturbed in the southeastern and southwestern corners, <br>
        We lie loving and warm, looking out from time to time. “Snowbound,” we say. We speak of the poet <br>
        Who lived with his young housekeeper long ago in the mountains of the western province, the kingdom <br>
        Of cruelty, where heads fell like wilted flowers and snow fell for many months <br>
        Across the pass and drifted deep in the vale. In our kitchen the maple-fire murmurs <br>
        In our stove. We eat cheese and new-made bread and jumbo Spanish olives <br>
        Which have been steeped in our special brine of jalapeños and garlic and dill and thyme. <br>
        We have a nip or two from the small inexpensive cognac that makes us smile and sigh. <br>
        For a while we close the immense index of images that is our lives—for instance, <br>
        The child on the Mescalero reservation in New Mexico sitting naked in 1966 outside his family’s hut, <br>
        Covered with sores, unable to speak. But of course we see the child every day, <br>
        We hold out our hands, we touch him shyly, we make offerings to his implacability. <br>
        No, the index cannot close. And how shall we survive? We don’t and cannot and will never <br>
        Know. Beyond the horizon a great unceasing noise is undeniable. The machine, <br>
        Like an immense clanking vibrating shuddering unnameable contraption as big as a house, as big as the whole town, <br>
        May break through and lurch into our valley at any moment, at any moment. <br>
        Cheers, baby. Here’s to us. See how the curtain of snow wavers and then falls back. <br> <br>

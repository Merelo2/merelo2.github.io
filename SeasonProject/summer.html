    Haze. Three student violists boarding <br>
    a bus. A clatter of jackhammers. <br>
    Granular light. A film of sweat for primer <br>
    and the heat for a coat of paint. <br>
    A man and a woman on a bench: <br>
    she tells him he must be psychic, <br>
    for how else could he sense, even before she knew, <br>
    that she’d need to call it off? A bicyclist <br>
    fumes by with a coach’s whistle clamped <br>
    hard between his teeth, shrilling like a teakettle <br>
    on the boil. I never meant, she says. <br>
    But I thought, he replies. Two cabs almost <br>
    collide; someone yells fuck in Farsi. <br>
    I’m sorry, she says. The comforts <br>
    of loneliness fall in like a bad platoon. <br>
    The sky blurs—there’s a storm coming <br>
    up or down. A lank cat slinks liquidly <br>
    around a corner. How familiar <br>
    it feels to feel strange, hollower <br>
    than a bassoon. A rill of chill air <br>
    in the leaves. A car alarm. Hail. <br>

        <p>
            Now that the winter's gone, the earth hath lost <br>
    Her snow-white robes, and now no more the frost<br>
    Candies the grass, or casts an icy cream<br>
    Upon the silver lake or crystal stream;<br>
    But the warm sun thaws the benumbed earth,<br>
    And makes it tender; gives a sacred birth<br>
    To the dead swallow; wakes in hollow tree<br>
    The drowsy cuckoo, and the humble-bee.<br>
    Now do a choir of chirping minstrels bring<br>
    In triumph to the world the youthful Spring.<br>
    The valleys, hills, and woods in rich array<br>
    Welcome the coming of the long'd-for May.<br>
    Now all things smile, only my love doth lour;<br>
    Nor hath the scalding noonday sun the power<br>
    To melt that marble ice, which still doth hold<br>
    Her heart congeal'd, and makes her pity cold.<br>
    The ox, which lately did for shelter fly<br>
    Into the stall, doth now securely lie<br>
    In open fields; and love no more is made<br>
    By the fireside, but in the cooler shade<br>
    Amyntas now doth with his Chloris sleep<br>
    Under a sycamore, and all things keep<br>
    Time with the season; only she doth carry<br>
    June in her eyes, in her heart January.<br><br>

            <a href="https://www.iowa.gov/" target="_blank"><b>Iowa</b></a>
            <p> State of Iowa's website is my favorite because it's very eye-pleasing in the sense of the use of a good color palette and effects and animations. It catches your attention easily and keeps you interested with more and more animations as you scroll through. Information is very well structured and displayed with the appropriate ways of showing it. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://www.vermont.gov/" target="_blank"><b>Vermont</b></a>
            <p> The state of Vermont's website is second on the list because the information it contains is well organized and displayed. The color palette is green to represent the Green Mountain State. It is also intuitive in the placement of the information and how it is displayed. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://www.tn.gov/" target="_blank"><b>Tennessee</b></a>
            <p> The state of Tennessee's website is not bad since it follows a consistent color palette and a somewhat modern design and look and feel. It is practical in the sense that all the information you need can be found on the homepage and well structured. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://alaska.gov/" target="_blank"><b>Alaska</b></a>
            <p> The state of Alaska's website could do better in terms of colors and using only 2d flat shapes. They can also look into utilizing the fullscreen of the device instead of just 50% of it. The fonts could be better and clearer. They should invest in more eye-catchy fonts for information that should be communicated. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://www.ok.gov/" target="_blank"><b>Oklahoma</b></a>
            <p> The state of Oklahoma's website is the worst of the bunch because the colors never blend and I found it personally to be an eyesore. No need for 3d animation anywhere. The title of the website doesn't explicitly say that it is the Oklahoma State Website which might create some confusion within users. There isn't much information on the homepage and might get displayed better. The font is an eyesore and the font size is small.  </p>
